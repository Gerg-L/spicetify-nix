# Themes
These are pre-packaged and somewhat tested themes. Provided you don't use a broken version of spicetify, you should be able to at least *use* spotify with these themes installed. Some of them won't necessarily look good due to mismatched and out of date versions (see the warning in the README).

## Official Themes
All of these themes can be found [here.](https://github.com/spicetify/spicetify-themes)
### Default
Identical to the default look of spotify, but with other colorschemes available.
